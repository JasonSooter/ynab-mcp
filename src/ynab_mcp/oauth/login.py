This is internet-facing once Funnel is on, and it is the only thing between
the public and the budget. So it is deliberately boring: one password, one
TOTP code, constant-time comparison, rate limiting, replay protection, and no
information in the error messages about which factor was wrong.

    Behind Tailscale Funnel there is a proxy in front, so the socket address is
    not the caller and X-Forwarded-For has to be consulted.

    Take the LAST entry, not the first. X-Forwarded-For is client-appendable:
    a caller can send their own header, and a proxy that appends rather than
    replaces leaves that forged value at the head of the list. Keying the
    limiter on it would let an attacker mint a fresh bucket per request simply
    by rotating the value -- and this limiter is what stands between the public
    internet and the password + TOTP form. The last entry is the one the
    nearest trusted proxy wrote, which is the only part we can rely on.

    appending, so first and last coincide today and the bypass is not live.
    This does not depend on that continuing to be true.)
